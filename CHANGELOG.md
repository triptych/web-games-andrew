## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Match-3 Game**: Fixed scoring bug where score would continuously increase after the first match
  - Issue: Destroyed gems were not being removed from the grid array, causing them to be counted multiple times in subsequent match checks
  - Solution: Added `grid[gem.gridY][gem.gridX] = null;` in `removeMatches()` function to properly clear grid positions when gems are destroyed
  - File: [game-002/index.html](game-002/index.html#L205)
