### Fixed
- **Tower Defense Game** (game-004): Fixed Kaplay styled text error with square brackets
  - Issue: Kaplay interprets square brackets `[` `]` as styled text tags, causing "unclosed tags" errors
  - Solution: Changed hotkey display from `[1]` to `(1)` format and updated instruction text to remove brackets
  - Files: [game-004/js/ui.js](game-004/js/ui.js)
- **Tower Defense Game** (game-004): Fixed tower panel height calculation
  - Issue: Panel background was too short, cutting off tower buttons beyond the first one
  - Solution: Added titleSpace constant (32px) to panel height calculation to account for "Towers" title
  - Files: [game-004/js/ui.js](game-004/js/ui.js)
- **Tower Defense Game** (game-004): Fixed tower panel not clickable
  - Issue: Tower buttons in the right panel were not responding to clicks
  - Solution: Added `k.area()` component to tower buttons and attached `onClick()` handlers directly to each button
  - Removed manual hit-testing in favor of Kaplay's built-in area-based click detection
  - Files: [game-004/js/ui.js](game-004/js/ui.js)
- **Tower Defense Game** (game-004): Improved UI text update reliability
  - Issue: Text objects not updating consistently in some Kaplay versions
  - Solution: Recreate text objects on state changes instead of modifying existing text properties
  - Stored text positions for reliable recreation
  - Files: [game-004/js/ui.js](game-004/js/ui.js)
- **Tower Defense Game** (game-004): Fixed click detection overlapping with UI panel
  - Issue: Clicking on the right tower panel would also place towers on the map behind it
  - Solution: Added exclusion zone for right panel area (130px width + 20px margin) in click detection
  - Files: [game-004/js/towers.js](game-004/js/towers.js)
- **NetHack-Style Roguelike** (game-003): Fixed level persistence - levels now remember their state
  - Issue: Descending and returning to previous levels generated new random maps each time
  - Solution: Implemented level storage system that saves/restores level state (map, monsters, items, FOV) by depth
  - Levels are now fully persistent - monsters stay dead, items stay where dropped, map layout unchanged
  - File: [game-003/js/Game.js](game-003/js/Game.js)
- **NetHack-Style Roguelike** (game-003): Fixed status bar not updating after closing inventory screen
  - Issue: Equipment stats would not display properly when returning from inventory view
  - Solution: Added `updateUI()` call after rendering to ensure status bar reflects current equipment state
  - File: [game-003/js/Game.js](game-003/js/Game.js#L270)
- **NetHack-Style Roguelike** (game-003): Fixed message log inconsistent height
  - Changed message log from `max-height` to fixed `height` for consistent display
  - File: [game-003/styles.css](game-003/styles.css#L103)
