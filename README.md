## Getting Started

### Playing the Games

1. Open [index.html](index.html) in your web browser
2. Browse the game collection
3. Click "Play Now" on any game to launch it in a modal player
4. Use ESC key or click the close button to return to the game browser

### Running Locally

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser:

```bash
# Using Python's built-in server (Python 3)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Playing Individual Games

You can also play games directly by opening their respective `index.html` files:
- Space Shooter: `game-001/index.html`
- Match-3 Puzzle: `game-002/index.html`
- NetHack Roguelike: `game-003/index.html`
- Tower Defense: `game-004/index.html`

## Building Desktop Versions

This project includes GemCore/GemShell configuration files for building standalone desktop applications.

### Configuration Files
Each game includes a `gemcore.config.json` file for customizing the build:
- Window size and settings
- Application name and icon
- Platform targets (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Build optimizations

### Building
Refer to the GemCore documentation for build instructions.

## Developer Documentation

The [docs/](docs/) directory contains reference material for AI-assisted development:

- **[docs/kaplay/](docs/kaplay/)** — Kaplay v4000 API reference and patterns
- **[docs/phaser/](docs/phaser/)** — Phaser 4.0.0 full API reference
- **[docs/threejs/](docs/threejs/)** — three.js r165 patterns (import map, render loop, bloom, gotchas)
- **[docs/generic/](docs/generic/)** — Cross-game learnings, sound design patterns, and game ideas

When building or modifying games, consult these docs for framework APIs, confirmed working patterns, and architectural guidance. **When you learn something reusable, fold it back into the matching doc** — see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the full index and the "Maintaining these docs" guide on what to write and where.
